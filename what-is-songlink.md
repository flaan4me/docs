### What Is Songlink?

With Songlink, you can share music better and more efficiently without worrying about which music streaming platform your friends, family or fans use. Our services find any song and album on every streaming platform and create a single smart link for you to share.

If you're a recording artist or record label, sharing your music with Songlink enables you to grow your audience faster and more efficiently. We route users to whichever streaming platform they use and love, which means that every single person who clicks on one of your Songlinks will be able to listen to your sound. As an added bonus for artists, we allow fans to purchase your music by providing links to it on digital stores like iTunes and Amazon.

To find a Songlink, head to our [web app](https://song.link) and use the search bar at the top of the page to find the song or album. Then share, share, share 🚀

### How To Use Songlink

Using Songlink to share music is easy as pie 🥧. Here are the steps:

**1. Make sure Songlink supports the song or album you want to share**

Songlink supports all songs and albums that are on the major streaming platforms. Currently, that includes Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, Pandora, SoundCloud, Google Play Music, Tidal, Deezer, Napster, Yandex.Music and Spinrilla. If the song or album you want to share is **not** already on one of these platforms, you will **not** be able to find it on Songlink. 😞

**2. Find the song or album on Songlink**

To find music on our platform, head to [our web app](https://song.link/) and use the search bar at the top of the page. You can search for a song by title and artist. For example, you can enter `Hello Adele` and a few results will pop up. If you click on the first result, you will be taken to the Songlink page for the song [Hello by Adele](https://song.link/us/i/1051394215).

If you cannot find what you're looking for, there's still hope! 🙏 You can paste the streaming service URL of the song or album into the search bar, hit Enter and you will be taken directly to the Songlink page for that song or album. For example, let's say you want to find the Songlink page for the album The Wall by Pink Floyd. You can paste the album URL from Spotify (or Apple Music or any of the streaming services) right into the search bar.

In this example, you would copy the album link from Spotify, which is `https://open.spotify.com/album/5Dbax7G8SWrP9xyzkOvy2F` and then paste it right into [our search bar](https://song.link/). We will then redirect you to the [Songlink page for that album](https://song.link/album/s/5Dbax7G8SWrP9xyzkOvy2F)!

**POWER USERS** 💪: You can append the song or album URL from Spotify, Apple Music, etc right after our domain to build valid Songlink URLs. So, in the example above, you can create the Songlink URL like so:

[https://song.link/](https://song.link/) + [https://open.spotify.com/album/5Dbax7G8SWrP9xyzkOvy2F](https://open.spotify.com/album/5Dbax7G8SWrP9xyzkOvy2F)

and you'll get a valid Songlink URL! [https://song.link/https://open.spotify.com/album/5Dbax7G8SWrP9xyzkOvy2F](https://song.link/https://open.spotify.com/album/5Dbax7G8SWrP9xyzkOvy2F)

**3. Share the Songlink!**

Once you've found the Songlink page you want to share, there's nothing left to do but to spread the goodness to your friends and family, fans and social media circles. You can copy the URL and the paste it into your text messages, emails or tweets. We also have handy shortcuts for quickly sharing via SMS, Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp and others. To access these shortcuts, click on the **SHARE** button right below the album artwork.

Share, share, share and spread the sound! 🚀
